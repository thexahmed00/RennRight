## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Before running the project, ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the App**

   To start the app, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   This will start the Expo development server. You will see options to open the app in a development build, Android emulator, iOS simulator, or Expo Go.

- **[`index.tsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FApp%2FRennt-it-right%2Fmy-app%2Fapp%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "d:\App\Rennt-it-right\my-app\app\index.tsx")**: This is the main entry point of your application. It defines the initial screen that users see when they open the app. The current content is a simple view with a centered text.

  ```tsx
  import { Text, View } from "react-native";

  export default function Index() {
    return (
      <View
        style={{
          flex: 1,
